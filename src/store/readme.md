In order to get this into another project, just copy /src/types and /src/store folders.

Then install redux and redux-saga:
npm i redux react-redux redux-saga   

We also need these other items:
npm i history connected-react-router redux-devtools-extension typesafe-actions

And some types:
npm i -D @types/history @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/react-redux @types/react-router-dom
